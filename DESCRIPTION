Description: A package that uses R6 Classes to perfrom Adaptive 
    Rejection Sampling based on W. R. Gilks, P. Wild (1992), 
    "Adaptive Rejection Sampling for Gibbs Sampling," Applied Statistics, 
    Vol. 41, Issue 2, 337-348. The function works for probability density 
    functions that are log-concave. The algorithm builds envelope functions 
    for sampling.
